## Projects
### LLM website builder

- Spearheaded the development of an LLM (Large Language Model) website builder application using langchain and llamaindex. 
- Implemented Advanced RAG (Auto merging retrieval), prompt engineering, and prompt fine-tuning to optimize LLM response.

### LLM agent dialogue managed chatbot

- Chatbot dialogue management expected to save $300,000 in dialogue management optimization for Dataknobs
- Orchestrated the creation of an LLM agents managed chatbot, employing DAG graph architecture
- Conducted end-to-end integration of LLM chatbot functionalities, incorporated Advanced RAG for client vector database retrieval.

## ARD Process Optimisation project 
- Streamlined the annual procurement process for the Indian Navy by developing an equipment consumption forecast model. 
- Resulted in an expected savings of INR 20 lakh.
- Deployed a fine-tuned BERT model to categorize reasons for order rejection comments, achieving an accuracy rate of 77%
- Made a CNN image classifier for payment receipts categorization achieving an accuracy of 81% using image augmentation 

## Chemical Processes modeling Application
- The application resulted in an estimated savings of 9% in fault detection and process monitoring 
- Facilitated model creation, validation, enhancing efficiency in fault detection, saving approximately 10000+ man hours
- Engineers use the application for analyzing Error-in-Variable time series sensor data from chemical reactors using Dynamic Iterative Principal component Analysis
